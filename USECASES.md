## HTML Media Focus - Use Cases

### Desktop use cases

1. Watch YouTube in foreground. Pause/resume with media keys.

2. Listen to YouTube lecture in background. Pause/resume with media keys.

3. Listen to Spotify in background tab. Start watching Netflix. Spotify pauses automatically.

4. Listen to music in background. Incoming email/message notification sound plays. Music ducks the volume for the duration of the notification.

5. Like 4, but a podcast where pausing and resuming slightly before the pause point allows you to not miss anything said.

6. Use keyboard back button to go back to the previously playing video(s) on YouTube.

7. Use back/forward media keys on keyboard to navigate a Spotify playlist.

8. Join a video chat in appear.in or Hangouts. Any playing media is paused.

### Mobile use cases

1. Pause/resume music using headphone buttons when crossing the street.

2. Continue listening to music when switching tabs or apps.

3. Continue listening when the screen is off.

4. Listening to a podcast while playing a game with minimal sound effects. Sound effects should have no effect (ducking) on the podcast.
